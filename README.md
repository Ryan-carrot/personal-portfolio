# personal-portfolio

A personal portfolio website built to showcase skills, projects, and background — based on the roadmap.sh **Portfolio Website** project.  
https://roadmap.sh/projects/portfolio-website

## 🌐 Project Overview

This repository hosts a portfolio website whose goal is to present an individual’s profile: biography, skills, projects, contact info, etc. It follows the structure and goals described in the “Portfolio Website” roadmap project.  

The current version uses **mock / placeholder data only** — no real personal or professional data. Feel free to replace with your own content.  

## 🚀 Getting Started / Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ryan-carrot/personal-portfolio.git
2. Open index.html (or your main HTML file) in your browser to view the site locally.
3. Replace mock data with your real information: name, bio, skills, projects, contact links, etc.
4. (Optional) Add styling (CSS), responsiveness, or extra pages as needed.
5. (Optional) Deploy the site using GitHub Pages (or any static site host) for a live public portfolio.

## 📄 Live Demo

Your portfolio is (or will be) deployed to GitHub Pages.
Live Site URL: https://YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME.github.io/personal-portfolio/
Replace YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME with your GitHub username.

Once deployed, visitors can view your portfolio at the above URL.

- A clean, static portfolio website structure
- Sections for about, skills, projects, contact info (or placeholders for them)
